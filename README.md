# Equipment Management System
The Equipment Management System is a Drupal 6 Module created with Features.
https://drupal.org/project/features

## Goals of this module
- List all the large scientific equipment in the MSL.
- Allow import of equipment data from Excel
- Restrict access to this system to only MSL/CHiBi personnel
- Allow searching of equipment.
- Capture the following REQUIRED information per piece of equipment:
  - Description
  - Location
  - Owner (Link to Lab contacts page)
  - Barcode
  - Status (In Service or Decommissioned)
  - Access
    - Restricted to owner (Default)
    - Permission granted by owner
    - Shared with all MSL/CHiBi
- Capture the following OPTIONAL information per piece of equipment:
  - Manufacturer
  - Supplier
  - Model
  - Date equipment was decommissioned (conditional field on Status)
  - Warranty (start date, end date)
  - Notes
  - File Attachments (manuals, software, photographs, etc.)

## Requirements
- Drupal 6
- Minimum 940px width for lists to be displayed properly.
- Patch to CCK content.module. CCK fields made private by Content Access permissions do not get indexed by the search. Thus all the equipment fields if you set them to authenticated access as they are by default to not get indexed and do not show up in your search.  There is a patch for the CCK content.module file as described here to allow our search to index the fields: https://drupal.org/node/510744 
Patch: https://drupal.org/files/issues/content_module_index_private_fields-510744-15.patch
